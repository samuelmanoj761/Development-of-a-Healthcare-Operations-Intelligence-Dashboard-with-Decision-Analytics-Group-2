"""
app.py
------
Single entry point for the Public Health Analytics multipage app.

Wires the 5-dashboard suite into one left-hand navigation menu (via
st.navigation) so the whole suite can be presented from one running app.

Order in the sidebar = order below. Executive Public Health Overview is
first and loads by default; it's the only dashboard that's fully built out
(it contains two tabs internally: Executive Summary and Disease
Surveillance, sharing one filter panel). The other four are empty
placeholders (data layer already wired up in src/data_loader.py) ready to
be filled in as each one is finished.

Run with:  streamlit run app.py
